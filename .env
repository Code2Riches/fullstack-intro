// ## .env files
// - _Reminder_: .env files hold our environment variables. When we start a server/terminal process, the variables in a .env file are loaded into the global scope and are accessable using the process.env.VARIABLE_NAME syntax. When we create a .env file in our file system, it will go on the top level of our repository; i.e, the same file level as the package.json. 
// - _Note_: After you create a .env file in your folder, you need to restart the terminal process for your environment variables to be loaded into the scope.
// - _Requirement_: React applications REQUIRE environment variables to be prepended with the string REACT_APP. I.E. All environment variables you will create for react MUST start with REACT_APP. Everything after the REACT_APP prefix is up to you to name for your variable.
// - All environment variables coming from the .env file will be strings
